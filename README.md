Name
PythonApi-Challenge - WeatherPy & VacationPy

Description
This project consists of two parts. The first part is creating a Python script to visualize the weather of 500+ cities across the world of varying distance from the equator. This will be accomplished by utilizing citypy, OpenWeatherMap and a little common sense to create a representative model of weather across world cities. The second part is run the random cities list through a mapping process to identify more desirable locations for prospective vacation plans. 

Key Deliverables
•	A series of scatter plots to showcase the following relationships:
  o	Temperature (F) vs. Latitude
  o	Humidity (%) vs. Latitude
  o	Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude
  o	Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude
•	Linear regression on each relationship for the Northern and Southern Hemisphers
  o	Northern Hemisphere - Temperature (F) vs. Latitude
  o	Southern Hemisphere - Temperature (F) vs. Latitude
  o	Northern Hemisphere - Humidity (%) vs. Latitude
  o	Southern Hemisphere - Humidity (%) vs. Latitude
  o	Northern Hemisphere - Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude
  o	Southern Hemisphere - Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude
o	Northern Hemisphere - Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude
  o	Southern Hemisphere - Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude
•	A Google heat map of each city in the study
•	A targeted list of cities with weather conditions more suitable for vacation
•	A Google map overlaying prospective hotels on top of the heat map

Topline (3 Key) Takeaways
1.	Maximum temperature is highly correlated with latitude
2.	Humidity, cloudiness and wind speed are not correlated with latitude
3.	Western Australia is looking like somewhere I would like to visit on holiday

Visuals
Please reference the WeatherPy and VacationPy Pitchbooks for visuals and additional takeaways. 

Installation
The Jupyter Notebook was run using Microsoft Edge instead of the recommended Google Chrome
The Notebook was run in the recommended PythonData environment with the following key installs: Pandas, nb_conda_kernels, numpy, scipy, and two jupyter exension installs to support the mapping.

Support
Please reference the Denver University GitLab repository for class materials and instructions.
